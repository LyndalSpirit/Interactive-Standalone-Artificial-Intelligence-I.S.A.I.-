# Interactive-Standalone-Artificial-Intelligence-I.S.A.I.-
Based from the Creation of Dante Sblendorio - https://gitlab.com/dsblendo/digital_assistant.git
A full AI system to Automate future homes. Currently being Developed for The Dreamweaver Foundation Project Arizona.
The goal is to create Standalone A.I. Systems that can work wih or without internet connection. The ability to network, have them work in groups or teams is also important.
Sa a security module or node is created, with a stand alone you have to be in the room with the source code to hack it.
Problem is that connection enables knowledge to an A.I. System
How do we create something to work in specific areas of our lives without exsposing it to limitations or vunerabilities?
Smart home automation that included features for disabled persons.
